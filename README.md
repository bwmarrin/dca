dca
====
`dca` is an audio file format that uses opus packets and json metadata.

This repository hosts the official specification draft for `dca` along with
an example implementation in Google Go.

There are also other implementations of the dca specification listed  below
which may be better than the example provided in this repository.

Currently, the **dca-rs** implementation provides the best performance and is 
probably the best version to use.

### Official Specifications
* [DCA1 specification draft](https://github.com/bwmarrin/dca/wiki/DCA1-specification-draft)

### Reference implementations
* [Google Go dca Command](https://github.com/bwmarrin/dca/tree/master/cmd/dca)
* Google Go Package coming eventually :)

### 3rd Party implementations
* [dca-rs](https://github.com/nstafie/dca-rs) - Rust implementation of the DCA1 format.
* [dCa](https://github.com/uppfinnarn/dca) - C implementation of the DCA0 format
